# Final project

- The project can be done in groups of 1-3 people.  
- You need to hand in a group contract establishing the team members and
  evaluation conditions (if different from default).
- A list of possible topics will be provided, you can also choose your own topic
  but this must be approved by Sharid first.
- You need to hand in one written report per group.  
- By default, there will be a joint equal grade for all members of the group,
  based on the written group report. This default can be overwritten by the
  group contract.
