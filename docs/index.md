Introduction to deep learning techniques for NLP. The goals of this course are:  

- To understand the structure of neural networks  
- To be familiar with central concepts in deep learning for NLP  
- To know the most common deep learning models applied in NLP  
- To implement your own deep learning models using the pytorch library

## Examination  

The following aspects are needed to pass the course:  

 - reaction paragraph for each pack of preparation material assigned per week
 - 3 assignments completed (A1, A2, A3)
 - project work: [presentation of a project proposal and written report of completed project](https://compling-potsdam.github.io/sose20-deep-nlp/final_project/instructions). 

**All hand in deadlines refer to the day at 11:00pm**

### Late policy for assignments 

There will be a second and final deadline for late submissions on July 14, 11:00pm. If you fail to meet the first deadline for reaction paragraphs or assignments, you may use this second deadline.
